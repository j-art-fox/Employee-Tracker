## Description
Have you ever worked for a horribly organzied company where information about employee ID numbers, salaries, and roles was a massive mess needing serious mending? No? Well you're lucky and are likely working for a company that uses software like this here fancy app I've developed for you all for free! Actually, I paid a lot in tuition to make this app for you so even better (for you)! 

With the Employee Tracker 5000 you're going to be able to access your company's database, see employee information, role information, salary information, department information and so much more. You'll also have the ability to edit that information to give yourself that raise you've been asking for but don't deserve!

By making this application I provided myself with lots of caffeine and time so I could navigate through the migraine inducing minefield of SQL queries and NPM packages such as inquirer and mysql2, that I seriously hope prove to be beneficial when I begin the process of job hunting because people with less than positive attitudes in my surroundings seem to love to remind me how a lot of the libraries I'm learning are obsolete which makes me feel depressed like an underbaked loaf of bread.

## Future Development

Moving forward, I'd like to hit on all of the criteria included in the bonus section of the readme file for this challenge, because each one of those was worth a tasty 20 extra credit points, but sadly you can only get a maximum of 100 points on this assignment, which even if you account for the fact that I'm likely going to lose a couple of points for a lack of professionalism on this README.md file, I still feel confident I'll be right about at 90-ish points, give or take so it wouldn't necesarily benefit my score, and when it comes to time managment, I feel I'd rather use it to get familiar with the content of the next library or framework we'll be working with.
